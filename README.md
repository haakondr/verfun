# Verfun

Verfun is a util for generating a checksum for a python function ignoring whitespace, comments, variable names, etc.

## Great, why is this useful?

Given a use case where you want to 

1. Version an algorithm that did something to your data
2. Rerun said algorithm on affected data if the algorithm changes
3. not rerun if you only add comments, refactor variable names, etc

## Status:

Very much work in progress, nothing working as of now
